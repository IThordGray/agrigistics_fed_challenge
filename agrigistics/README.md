# Agrigistics

## How long did this take?
Just shy of 5 hours

## What would I do to improve the solution?
The mobile view design was a little vague, and I would like to do it correctly. I THINK the idea is to make a list view carousel, but I also ran out of time. Given more time, 
I think that would make it a nice use case. The inputs don't align as nice with the design, but that's because it's Angular material. I suspect the designs are a more custom version,
or perhaps the bootstrap material implementation. The typography also doesn't align 100%.  But again just Angular material issues. 

## Feedback
Definitely the most involved exercise I've done in terms of a skills' assessment. Overall a really fun experience. 
I think the mobile expectations could have been a bit clearer.
